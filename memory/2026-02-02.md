- User clarified: morning brief trigger is implicit when they say “good morning” (send now).
- Add a “Top 3 priorities” section to the morning brief.
- Pulled brief sources: Riverside community calendar, Riverside County Fire live incident feed, Riverside County Sheriff newsflash RSS, weather via Open‑Meteo for Riverside (33.98,-117.37).
- User asked to add/remember brief *format* preferences (concise, skimmable, section labels, bullets, links when relevant).
- Next integration requested: Google Keep shopping list. There is a pinned note named "Shopping List"; append as checkbox items; de-dupe via merge/normalize; triggers include "Add <items> to shopping list" and "Add shopping list: <items>"; prefer official Google Keep API if possible.
- User confirmed: make Keep integration a subtask of the larger project "Minnie to Google Integration"; use specialized agent for higher-quality UX; account = thane.j.thompson@gmail.com; GCP project = Minnie; these defaults should apply across Google services (Calendar/Drive/Sheets/Gmail/Keep/Voice/etc.).
- Keep API limitation confirmed: cannot append/update existing pinned note; new approach: maintain internal canonical shopping list during conversation and publish to Keep by creating a new checklist note at end/when requested.
